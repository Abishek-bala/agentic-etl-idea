# Agentic ETL Idea

This repository contains a proposal for applying LLM-powered workflows and agents in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, prepared as part of an **Innovation Sprint assignment**.

## Assignment

> Take a common process in your role/project/department.
> 
> - Design it as a workflow (fixed steps: Step 1 â†’ Step 2 â†’ Step 3)  
> - Redesign it as an agent (LLM decides: "Based on situation X, I'll use tools Y and Z")  
> 
> Compare both integrations and justify when youâ€™d use a predictable workflow vs. a dynamic agent.  
> Upload your work as a PPT with diagrams and explanations.  

## Context

As a data engineer, I frequently work on file ingestion and cleaning pipelines. This proposal explores how such pipelines can be enhanced using:

- **LLM-based workflows** (using prompt chains or fixed logic)
- **Autonomous agents** (using ReAct-style reasoning and tool use)

A hybrid solution is also discussed, combining the reliability of workflows with the adaptability of agents.
